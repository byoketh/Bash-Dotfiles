# Bash Aliases
these are bash aliases i use in most of my linux environments

these aliases work for me, in my environment and on my systems. i make no promises other than they should work if you are careful. i have used comments to indicate which aliases need certain files/packages in order to work properly. review before using.

this is a constant work in progress. so there will be updates!!

if you find issues, or know a better/more effective way to write anything, please file an issue to let me know!!
