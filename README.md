# Bash Dotfiles
These are bash dotfiles I use in most of my linux environments.

These aliases work for me, in my environment, and on my systems. I make no promises other than they should work if you are careful. I have used comments to indicate which aliases need certain files/packages in order to work properly. Review before using.

This is a constant work in progress. So there will be updates!!

If you find issues, or know a better/more effective way to write anything, please file an issue to let me know!!
